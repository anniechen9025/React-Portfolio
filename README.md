# 20. React Portfolio

## Description
We had been learning how to use React to write jss to build our website. I learn how to use components and props to pass down the variable we want it to be use in another components. I used all skills I had learn so far to build a portfolio with them. It was challenge to using this new kinds of  react thinking to work it logically. Overall I was able to get all the pieces together and render the page in the way was expected.
